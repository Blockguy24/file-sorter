# File Sorter
A small utility to help me sort files when a more manual approach is required

# Scenario
- There are a lot of files in my Downloads folder
- There may be stuff there that I want to keep so I shouldn't just `rm -rf *`
- It appears that I must sort through the files manually, but the task feels too big to manage so I decide to leave it for a later date
