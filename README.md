# File Sorter
A small utility to help me sort files when a more manual approach is required

## Scenario
- There are a lot of files in my Downloads folder
- There may be stuff there that I want to keep so I shouldn't just `rm -rf *`
- It appears that I must sort through the files manually, but the task feels too big to manage so I decide to leave it for a later date

## What does this do then?
- The application picks 3 random items from the folder
- I am able to select them and perform actions such as Open, Move and Delete
- After sorting these 3 items, I press Reroll to get another 3 items
- Repeat until the folder is empty

## What does it look like?

## Results
- Finally an empty Downloads folder
